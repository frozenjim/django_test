# django_test

This is the code from Mike Hibberts great "Python Django Tutorial" series on Youtube. 
The tutorial is in an older version of Django so this repository holds the updated
version of his tutorial.  

Basically, as I followed Mike's tutorial, I checked the docs to confirm if each command 
he was using was consistent with Django 1.8.  Where he differed from the new standard, I 
made the correction.

If you are following Mike's tutorial and am stuck, have a look at how I handled it.  Nothing
posted here is broken - if you see it, it worked for me.

As I am a complete newby to Django AND Python, this may not be perfect.  But it works!!
